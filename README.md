## Introduction

Tpclassifier is a Python library that contains functions to train and apply classifiers for textual documents. It is
based on Python scikit-learn library, and it provides an easy interface to train and use classifiers. In addition,
tpclassifier includes functions to transform documents from pdf and Textpresso CAS files (both generated from pdf or xml
files) into text and simplify their management to create training and test sets for the classifiers.

The complete documentation of the library can be found [here](http://tpclassifier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
